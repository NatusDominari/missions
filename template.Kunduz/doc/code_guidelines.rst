These are more free-form and general coding guidelines, for a more formal style
specification, see code_style.txt.

Keeping template generic
========================

This template should be a base for missions, a framework. It may be tempting,
however, to hardcode some aspects and structures one's community uses for the
sake of simplicity.

This might come in the form of hardcoded group names (IDs) for units, modded
radio channels, or even generic-ish tuning of global variables used by some
mods to alter the behavior of these mods.

This approach however limits the template to a specific gameplay and mission
setup style, ie. "regular army" missions with an organized radio net, making
it difficult or unusable for other styles, ie. guerilla/civilian missions.

It is highly advised, if not required, to design the template functionality
in an opt-in way, which mission creators can easily enable, but also don't have
to.
For example - need to adjust a global variable from a mod? Create a function
to do that and let the mission creator use it. Have multiple of these, altering
the mod for a specific style? Have a function that calls the other (smaller)
functions and let the mission creator use this aggregating function.

**Do not** assume how the template is used, do not design mission styles into
the template, but do provide tools for the mission creator to do so.

Keeping features simple
=======================

Generic approach in mind should be applied to the feature scope as well,
that is - aim for universal functionality, not for mod compatibility. If
possible, don't explicitly design for mod interoperability, design a way
which doesn't need mod-specific workarounds.

If the functionality cannot be implemented in a generic way and/or it conflicts
with most mods, perhaps it provides functionality similar to some of the mods,
consider *not* including it in this template.

Remember - the main goal is to be the toolbox for the mission creator, not
a full blown mod pretending to be a mission framework.

Function API specification
==========================

BIS functions use a semi-formal block comment with parameters/return of the
function, similarly to how ie. Doxygen does it. However, as BIS functions are
a proof of, this style is hard to maintain consistently across complex data
types (ie. list), their nesting and index specifications.

A more relaxed description not only yields better understanding behind the
intentions of the function and its parameters, but allows to, more naturally,
split explanation of complex nested types according to what best suits the
specific case.
This relaxed description is more widely known as 'manpage' style.

Consider::

    /*
        Description:
        Prepares dinner using exactly 4 ingredients.

        Parameters:
            0: NUMBER - How many meals to make
            1: ARRAY
                0:
                    0: OBJECT - First ingredient type
                    1: OBJECT - First ingredient amount
                1:
                    0: OBJECT - Second ingredient type
                    1: OBJECT - Second ingredient amount
                2:
                    0: OBJECT - Third ingredient type
                    1: OBJECT - Third ingredient amount
                3:
                    0: OBJECT - Fourth ingredient type
                    1: OBJECT - Fourth ingredient amount

        Returns:
        ARRAY - N: Number of meals specified
            N: OBJECT - Finished meal to serve
    */

    params ["_meals", "_ingreds"];

Versus::

    /*
     * Prepares dinner using exactly 4 ingredients, given as a 4-member
     * '_ingreds' array, each ingredient specifying [type, amount],
     * making '_meals' dishes in total.
     * Returns a total of '_meals' finished meals as an array.
     */

    params ["_meals", "_ingreds"];

This is indeed an extreme case, but it showcases how a free-form description
can be more flexible and easier to understand, if written correctly.

Both specifications are allowed within this template, however the latter
is preferred. Care should be taken to provide as clear and as exact description
as possible, avoiding any double meanings or potential misrepresentations.

Both specifications allow and recommend being extra verbose where needed, such
as when the function has special requirements on properties of the arguments,
atypical to what the programmer would expect.
