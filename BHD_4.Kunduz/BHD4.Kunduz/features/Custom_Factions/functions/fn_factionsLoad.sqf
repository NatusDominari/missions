/*
 * Algorithm:
 * The obvious way would be to simply walk the classes.txt line-by-line and
 * calling the code if the classname matches. Since SQF is abysmally slow when
 * iterating, this can be really slow for larger classes.txt (100s of lines).
 *
 * However any other approach doesn't guarantee execution flow - ie. if we were
 * to walk BIS_fnc_returnParents and execute files from the oldest parent, it
 * would get us inheritance exec order, not class.txt order.
 *
 * The other extreme case is to walk classes.txt, iterating configClasses (cmd)
 * and adding the pre-processed files (CODE) into each matching class. There are
 * approx. 10000 of classes though, eating lots of memory, but also taking ~15ms
 * per class during preInit, resulting in about 150sec delay.
 * The runtime cost would be very low though, as each class would know exactly
 * which CODEs to run, without searching the list and matching classnames.
 *
 * We take the middle road - we do the "slow" classes.txt walk for each class
 * only once and then remember (cache) the result, simply executing the cached
 * result for a given class next time, with virtually zero overhead.
 * This allows us to cache only classes which are actually used in the mission
 * while (almost) getting the speed benefit as if we pre-cached everything.
